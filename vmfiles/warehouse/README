This folder contains the tables saved as system tables in Spark SQL. Its contents
should not be modified outside Spark.

Since it is on the Vagrant shared folder, it will be preserved accross VM 
reinstallations.

Access to a table requires the corresponding metastore_db folder (typically created 
in the Notebook folder that created the table).
